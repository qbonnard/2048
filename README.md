# AR 2048

An in-browser, Augmented Reality proof of concept of Gabriele Cirulli's game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

It is a quick and dirty afternoon hack, with huge performance issue, as the tag detection happens in the same thread as the display. It is playable though, and you can [try it here.](http://qbonnard.github.io/2048/)
